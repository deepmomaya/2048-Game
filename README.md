# 2048-Game

In this project, I have built a web-based version of the popular 2048 puzzle game, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players slide numbered tiles on a 4x4 grid using the arrow keys to merge them and create a tile with the number 2048. Simply clone the repository, open html file in a web browser, and enjoy playing!
